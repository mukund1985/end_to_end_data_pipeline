# End to End Azure Data Engineering Project

## Project Overview

Setting up an end-to-end Azure Data Engineering project as described involves multiple Azure services and components, each playing a crucial role in the data pipeline from ingestion to reporting.

Here's a structured approach to setting up your project, based on the detailed walkthrough you provided:

## Architecture Overview

Your architecture involves:

- **Data Ingestion**: Using Azure Data Factory (ADF) to migrate data from an on-premise SQL Server to Azure.
- **Data Storage** : Storing ingested data in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.
- **Data Processing** and Transformation: Utilizing Azure Databricks for data transformation and employing a Lakehouse architecture for data layering (bronze, silver, gold).
- **Data Loading**: Loading transformed data into Azure Synapse Analytics for querying and analysis.
- **Data Reporting**: Creating reports and dashboards with Power BI by connecting to Azure Synapse Analytics.

## Implementation Steps

**Data Ingestion**

- Install Integration Runtime(IR) on the on-premise network to enable Azure Data Factory to connect to the on-premise SQL Server.
- Create an ADF Pipeline with a "Copy Data" activity to migrate data from SQL Server to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, using the installed IR for connectivity.

**Data Storage**

- Configure Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 as the sink for the ingested data, ensuring data is stored in Parquet format for efficient storage and access.

**Data Processing and Transformation**

- Set up Azure Databricks: Create a workspace and Spark clusters for data processing.
- Mount Azure Data Lake Storage to Databricks to access ingested data.
- Develop Transformation Logic in Databricks notebooks, transforming data from the bronze layer to silver and gold layers, utilizing Delta format for storage.

**Data Loading**

- Utilize Azure Synapse Analytics for data loading, creating views or tables as needed for reporting purposes.
- Automate View Creation in Synapse Analytics to reflect the structure of data in the gold layer of Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.

**Data Reporting**

- Connect Power BI to Azure Synapse Analytics to create interactive dashboards and reports based on the data in the gold layer.

## Automation and CI/CD

- Implement CI/CD pipelines for automating the deployment and updating of data pipelines based on schema changes or new data requirements.
- Use Terraform for infrastructure as code to provision and manage Azure resources.
- Automate monitoring and re-running of pipelines in case of failures.

## Security and Governance

- Utilize Azure Active Directory for managing access and identities.
- Store sensitive information such as connection strings in Azure Key Vault, ensuring secure access to databases and services.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- Set up monitoring for all components of the data pipeline to ensure smooth operation and quick troubleshooting of any issues.
- Regularly review and update the data processing logic in Azure Databricks to accommodate changes in data structure or business logic.
